    Impedance changes during gesture recognition include changes of contact impedance between electrode-skin and changes of internal impedance in the wrist section.As shown in following figure, network A is the electrode-skin model describing the contact impedance. R_{Ele} and C_{Ele} are the resistance and capacitance between the electrode and the surface of conductive glue, respectively, and R_{Glu} is the resistance produced by the conductive glue [27]. The values of R_{Ele}, C_{Ele} and R_{Glu} depend on the contact state (e.g., different contact areas and pressures) between electrodes and skin. Network B is the basic unit of the impedance network in the wrist section, which describes the impedance characteristics of the biological tissue unit at the specific position. The values of R_\Omega and C_\Omega depend on the type (e.g., bones, muscle, and blood vessels) and physiological state (e.g., muscle relaxation, contraction, and edema) of the biological tissue unit at that position.
